            Medical illustration dates as far back as the earliest human
            civilizations and the earliest illustrations were included in cave
            drawings as old as 3,000 B.C., depicting basic anatomy and injuries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anatomical drawings did not develop quickly, however, since some
            early civilizations, such as in Ancient China, included laws against
            dissections and thus illustrations were much more conceptual than
            they were accurate. The general view in the ancient world was that
            the human body was a sacred entity and human dissection was
            protested against well into the 19th century, hindering the
            progression of anatomical studies.

            In medieval times, illustrations of anatomical systems, pathologies,
            and even illustrations of treatment methodologies began to emerge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medical illustrations naturally developed under the influence of
            historical, social, and technological developments through the ages.
            Those completed in the medieval period reflect an early reliance on
            classical teachings, rather than direct observation, so internal
            structures depicted are by no means accurate.

            Early medical illustrations focused on art and the beauty and
            proportion of the human form over the science being represented.
            Medical illustrations were primarily featured as ornaments or
            portraiture on vases, columns, and tablets in early civilizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 400-300 B.C, medical illustration finally began to turn to
            instruction with Hippocrates' teachings, although the focus remained
            on animals. Then, in Hellenic Alexandria around 280 B.C.,
          </p>
          <p>
            Herophilus, a Greek physician considered to be one of the earliest
            anatomists, initiated the practice of human dissection and the
            scientific foundations of medical illustration were laid.
          </p>

        <!--Roman-->

          <p>
            Medical illustration did not progress much in Roman times, since the
            law still forbade human dissection. Some examples of illustrations
            popped up, though they mostly depicted battle or delivery scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Galen, a renowned physician, surgeon, and philosopher in the Roman
            Empire was able to further anatomical and surgical knowledge to a
            limited extent, but his work was again based mainly on animal
            dissections.

        <!--Renaissance-->
        <section>
          <p>
            The practice of medical illustration finally reached a breakthrough
            in the Renaissance period. This was largely thanks to human
            dissection finally being permitted and anatomists worked closely
            with artists to produce quality, accurate illustrations. The first
            publications of text juxtaposed with illustrations also came about
            in this period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jacopo Berengario da Carpi, an Italian physician, is credited with
            the first anatomical text with illustrations, his Isagoge breves, in
            1522.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andreas Vesalius followed this with the publication of his seven
            volume De humani corporis fabrica in 1543, a work known for such
            highly detailed illustrations of dissections that it is considered
            one of the most influential books on human anatomy. Vesalius is
            often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy and his
            works were groundbreaking in the history of medical publishing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also in this period, Leonardo da Vinci, amongst all of his other
            accomplishments, became the first medical illustrator in a
            contemporary sense. His depictions of the human body melded
            scientific understanding with great artistic talent and he produced
            nearly 800 anatomical drawings based on his own dissections.
            Unfortunately, his anatomical work went unpublished within his
            lifetime and were eventually passed through Spain to England, where
            they were eventually brought to light in 1760. They are still owned
            by the British Crown today and remain in the Royal Library at
            Windsor Castle.

            After the accomplishments of the Renaissance period, it became
            virtually inconceivable to describe anatomy solely with text.
            Numerous illustrated texts were produced over the next few
            centuries. Advancement was made especially possible due to
            lithography.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1725, Berhard Siegfried Albinius worked with artist and engraver
            Jan Wandelaar to produce two new books of muscular and skeletal
            anatomy, the Tabulae sceleti et musculorum corporis humani, which
            pursued new scientific accuracy within its engravings.

            The 19th century also brought about advancements in printing that
            allowed for illustration work in a variety of media and especially
            in color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the texts produced post-Renaissance, one of the best-known is
            Gray's Anatomy, from Henry Gray and Henry Vandyke Carter in 1858.
            The book has been widely influential for its showcasing of a variety
            of anatomy depiction techniques. It continues to be revised and
            republished to the present day; its latest edition, the 41st, came
            out in 2015.

            Although its impact on medical illustration came later, it is also
            important to note the invention of the X-Ray in 1895 by German
            physicist Konrad Roentgen, since it made internal imaging a
            possibility.

            It wasn't until the last century that the practice of medical
            illustration finally developed into a profession in its own right.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the 19th century, German Max Broedel came to America
            to join the John Hopkins Hospital as an artist. He employed new
            methods and created new techniques for illustrating and he went on
            to become known as the father of modern medical illustration. In
            1911, he presided over the creation of the first academic department
            of medical illustration, which still exists and which served as a
            model for other medical illustration programs around the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another notable artist of the century was Dr. Frank H. Netter, who
            progressed from freelance art during his medical training to the
            1989 publication of Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy and work with
            CIBA Pharmaceutical Company. In all, he produced thousands of
            illustrations and countless publications in his career and his works
            have become staples of medical education.

            Hand-drawn and painted illustration still have their place even
            today, but the further development of photography and later digital
            imaging in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed for new techniques
            and possibilities in the practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern day medical illustrators can complete a three-year graduate
            program at a number of institutions in North America and Europe and
            can choose to specialize in both their medium and their subject
            matter. They produce material and serve as consultants and
            administrators within biocommunications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In modern day practice, medical illustrations can take all sorts of
            forms, both hand-drawn and digital, and continue to be highly
            relevant and useful. Understanding of anatomical science continues
            to progress and medical illustrations are just as useful for
            educational purposes like models and textbooks, as they are for
            depicting new understandings in research and surgical techniques.
            Medical illustration is an ongoing practice and will continue to be
            as the pursuit of medicine continues.
