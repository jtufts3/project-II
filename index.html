        <h1>A History of Medical Illustration</h1>
        <p>
          Medical Illustration and the process of visualizing human anatomy and
          biology has a long, extensive history, dating back to some of the
          earliest human civilizations. Although the modern invention and
          development of digital imaging changed the process of medical
          illustration, it is still an important part of the medical world
          today.
