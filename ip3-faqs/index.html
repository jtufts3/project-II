            <p>
              What recent developments have occurred in medical illustration in
              the new century?
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of emphasis is being given to computer graphics and all the
              potential behind digital imaging, especially as the technology for
              internal imaging continues to progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              New discoveries are also in need of illustration, such as new
              surgical techniques or the results of newly published research, so
              medical illustrators are called upon to create visualizations for
              these as they come up.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the best examples of this is for the current coronavirus
              pandemic: when the virus went global, organizations like the CDC
              and WHO led the charge with the first illustrations of the virus
              which have served as models for other illustrations around the
              globe.

          <button class="accordion">Hand-drawn versus digital</button>
          <div class="open-FAQ">
            <p>
              With all of the recent developments in digital imaging, do we
              still need the tradition of hand-drawn illustrations?
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer is yes! Hand-drawn illustrations can at times be more
              costly and time-consuming, but the detail, precision, and quality
              of hand-drawn illustrations is hard to beat, so both methods are
              still very much in use.

          <button class="accordion">Beyond the textbooks</button>
          <div class="open-FAQ">
            <p>
              What use is medical illustration beyond textbook illustrations?
              What else is it used for?
            </p>
            <p>
              Medical illustration does have a lot of educational purpose, but
              it is very much a part of biocommunications in general. Medical
              illustration is a way to communicate scientific, medical concepts
              in a way that might be easier to understand at all levels, rather
              than just a block of text.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is popularly used in textbooks, but also in terms of data
              visualization, video graphics, and 3D imaging. Patient education
              is a particularly important use, as is the illustration of
              sub-molecular processes, use by attorneys for clarification in
              personal injury and medical malpractice cases, and in computer
              simulations.

          <button class="accordion">Impact of photography</button>
          <div class="open-FAQ">
            <p>
              If we can take photographs of the human body, why do we still need
              medical illustration?
            </p>
            <p>
              Medical illustration is important in conjunction with photography
              because it can be especially useful in depicting concepts we can't
              capture on camera, yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internal imaging and microscopes have come a long way and can be
              incredibly powerful, but sometimes medical illustration is still
              the best way to depict what is happening in the body, especially
              at a sub-molecular level too small to be seen by cameras and
              microscopes.

          <button class="accordion">As a profession</button>
          <div class="open-FAQ">
            <p>What is medical illustration like as a profession?</p>
            <p>
              Although it is a small profession, with fewer than 2,000
              practitioners worldwide, medical illustrators work diversely as
              professional artists in biocommunications, working to promote
              education, research, public relations, and marketing in medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The field changes rapidly as medicine, science, technology, and
              engineering continue to advance, so medical illustrators work to
              provide accurate visual communications in all these fields.
            </p>

            <p>
              Medical illustrators often pursue graduate studies and many
              specialize in either subject matter, media, or specific targets in
              their work.
